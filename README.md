# Hashtag

A parser for finding hashtags in strings. For example parsing `Rust is #awesome` gives you `awesome` and its location within the string.

The goal of this crate is to match Instagram's parsing of hashtags. So if you find strings that aren't parsed correctly please open an issue ðŸ˜ƒ

## Sample usage

```rust
extern crate hashtag;

use hashtag::Hashtag;

pub fn main() {
    let tags: Vec<Hashtag> = Hashtag::parse("#rust is #awesome");
    println!("{:?}", tags);
    // => [
    //     Hashtag { text: "rust", start: 0, end: 4 },
    //     Hashtag { text: "awesome", start: 9, end: 16 }
    // ]
}
```

## Benchmarking

I have written a fairly simple benchmarking.

Run it with:

    cargo build --release && ./target/release/benchmark
